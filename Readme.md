### Presentation on D3.js for KWLUG.


Per request, I've created a presentation overview of how D3.js
can be used for data visualization.

The slideshow (i.e. BarChart Slideshow 2.pdf, or slightly more up-to-date 
version at
[my NextCloud OnlyOffice](https://nextcloud.ronaldbarnes.ca/s/zr364LZEWyZcepd),
is roughly how the topics will be presented as we progress through the 
pages (each loads a slightly enhanced JS file).


See a "live" version at [my website](http://bclug.ca:8008/d3/kwlug/bar-chart/).
