### Presentation on D3.js for KWLUG.


Per request, I've created a presentation overview of how D3.js
can be used for data visualization.

The slideshow (i.e. BarChart Slideshow.pdf, or slightly more up-to-date 
version at
[my NextCloud OnlyOffice](https://nextcloud.ronaldbarnes.ca/s/zr364LZEWyZcepd)),
is roughly how the topics will be presented as we progress through the 
pages (each loads a slightly enhanced JS file).


See a "live" version at [my website](http://bclug.ca:8008/d3/kwlug/bar-chart/).

This presentation happened on July 11th, 2022 and was surprisingly successful!

I appreciate the kind comments, those in attendance had some good questions
and seemed to gain a solid overview of how D3.js operates.

And, they enjoyed the D3.js gallery, made by far smarter coders than me.

I was very concerned that, in my practising, I was hesitant and self-doubting.
Kept finding little tweaks to the slideshow, just didn't feel confident about it.

Once we went live, it felt like it flowed beautifully. Returned to some points
repetitively just enough to ensure understanding of how scales work, and how 
the D3 General Update Pattern works.

I was tweaking the presentation right up until I had solo control of the mic
(I switched to showing the D3.js Gallery first to grab their attention, *then*
I proceeded with my slideshow).
