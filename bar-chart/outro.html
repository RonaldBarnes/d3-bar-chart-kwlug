		<h2>Binding data to HTML / SVG elements in D3</h2>
		<p>
			Interactive demonstration of the D3.js General Update Pattern:
			<a href="https://www.d3indepth.com/v4/enterexit/" target="_new">
				.enter, update, .exit
			</a>
		</p>

		<hr />
		<p>
			Per the <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_new">D3 Intro</a> page:
			A common pattern is to break the initial selection into three parts: 
			the updating nodes to modify, then entering nodes to add, 
			and the exiting nodes to remove. 
		</p>
		<p>
			By <b>modifying only the attributes that actually change</b>,
			D3 reduces overhead and allows greater graphical complexity at 
			high frame rates. D3 also allows sequencing of complex transitions 
			via events. And, you can still use CSS3 transitions; 
			D3 does not replace the browser’s toolbox, but exposes it in a way 
			that is easier to use. 
		</p>

		<h2>Mapping</h2>
		<p>
			Nearly 100
			<a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-map-svg" target="_new">
			map projections</a>, featuring some facinating views of Earth.
		</p>

		<hr />
		<p>
			<!-- a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4183330" target="_new" -->
			<a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/world-tour" target="_new">
			World Tour</a> is mesmerizing and hypnotic viewing, featuring an
			animated geography lesson, featuring polygonal centroids:
			<h4>World Tour</h4>
			This animation uses d3.geoInterpolate to interpolate a path along
			great arcs, and spherical linear interpolation to rotate the
			orthographic projection.
		</p>

		<p>
			Full <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery" target="_new">
			D3 gallery</a> for some truly mind-boggling projects.

		<h2>Transistions</h2>
		<p>
			Intro to 
			<a href="https://www.d3indepth.com/transitions/" target="_new">
				interactive transitions</a>
			with code examples; note the "tween" interpolation functions
			about ⅔ of the way down the page.
			</a>
		</p>

		<h2>Fisheye Distortion</h2>
		<p>
			The possibilities are endless with D3.js.  Enhance tightly grouped data
			with a <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/fisheye/" target="_new">
			Fisheye Effect</a>, or a Cartesian Distortion
		</p>
		<h2>D3.js v7</h2>
		<p>
			This presentation was developed using D3.js version 4. At the time of
			this writing, v7.4.4 is "Latest".
